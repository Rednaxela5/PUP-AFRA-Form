# About the Website
PUP AFRA is your pathway to academic renewal, where AFRA stands for "Application for Re-Admission." As an integral part of PUPWebSite, the official portal of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, we're dedicated to providing a streamlined and supportive process for students seeking a second chance at their educational journey.
